Weather application

A weather application built using React and Vite. The app allows users to view current weather information based on their location or by searching for a city. It fetches data from a weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface with various weather icons representing different weather conditions.

Key Features
Real-time weather updates: Fetches weather data from a reliable API.
City search functionality: Users can search for the weather by city name.
Weather icons: Dynamic weather icons based on the conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).
Responsive design: Works well on different screen sizes and devices.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Vite: A fast build tool and development server.
CSS: Styling the components.
Weather API: (Add the name of the API you used, e.g., OpenWeather, WeatherStack, etc.)
ESLint: Ensures code quality and consistency.
Git: Version control for managing the project.

Setting up Vite: Vite is used as the build tool to speed up the development process. Itâ€™s important that the development server runs properly after installation.
Fetching Weather Data: The application fetches weather data asynchronously using fetch or axios. Make sure the API key is correct and valid.
Error Handling in Fetch: Always check the API response and handle errors (e.g., invalid city names or network errors).
Handling User Input: Be cautious of edge cases where the user might enter invalid data (e.g., empty input or non-existent cities).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
